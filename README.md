Dataset Information
Life expectancy at birth: The number of years a newborn would live if the patterns of mortality at the time of birth remain the same throughout his life.

Fertility rate: Number of children a woman would give birth to during her childbearing years. 

Country population: Total number of residents regardless of legal status or citizenship (midyear estimates)
You have to build the same animated graph as you watched in the video. Before you start with the visualization you have to perform the following steps: 
Load Data
Data Overview
Handle Missing Values
Data Types
Merge DataFrames (If required for any visualization)
In case you want to perform basic visualizations apart from the animated one, consider the below pointers:
Population Trends (Years vs Population)(Line Graph)
Fertility rate distribution 
Life expectancy variation
Correlation Analysis
Regional Analysis

Hint: 
1. Load all three datasets 
2. Data preprocessing on each dataset
3. Use the Pandas dataset merge method (DataFrame.merge) to combine the 3 datasets
4. Create a list of continents with their counties and then use if else to create a new column for each continent. 
One more dataset `Metadata_Country` - you will find the column Region along with the Country code.
